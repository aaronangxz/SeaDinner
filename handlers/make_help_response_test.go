		"1. /key to tell me your Sea API key. This is important because without the key, I'm basically useless. When you refresh your key, remember to let me know in /newkey\n" +
		"2. /menu to browse through the dishes, and tap the button below to snatch. There are also options to choose a random dish or skip ordering. Do take note that if you choose to skip, I will remember that and stop ordering forever until you tell me to do so again.\n" +
		"3. /choice to check the current dish I'm tasked to order.\n" +
		"4. /status to see what you have ordered this week, and the order status.\n" +
		"5. /mute to stop receiving morning reminders. Not recommended tho!\n\n" +

		"1. I will send you a daily reminder at 10.30am (If you never mute or skip order on that day). Order can be altered easily from the quick options:\n" +

		"ðŸ™… to stop ordering\n" +
		"2. At 12.29pm, I will no longer entertain your requests, because I have better things to do! Don't even think about last minute changes.\n" +
		"3. At 12.30pm sharp, I will begin to order your precious food.\n" +
		"4. It is almost guranteed that I can order it in less than 500ms. Will drop you a message too!\n\n" +
		"*Disclaimer*\n" +
		"By using my services, you agree to let me store your API key. However, not to worry! Your key is encrypted with AES-256, it's very unlikely that it will be stolen.\n\n" +
