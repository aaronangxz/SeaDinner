<h1> How To Use </h1>

1. Chat with `SeaHungerGamesBot` on Telegram.
2. Retrieve API key from https://dinner.sea.com/accounts/token, retrieve the token and tell the bot.
3. Play with the available commands:

| Command     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `/start`    | Begin chatting with the bot. If it is your first time, the bot will prompt for your key.|
| `/key`      | Check if your key is remembered by the bot.|
| `/newkey`   | Update a new key.        |
| `/menu`     | Check today's menu.        |
| `/chope`    | Select the food that you want to order.        |
| `/choice`   | Check the current food that you tasked the bot to order.        |
| `/status`   | Check the order status of today.        |

4. The bot will not entertain anymore requests 1 minute before and after `12.30`, and proceed to order for you.
5. It will tell you if the order is successful.
6. Remember to collect and eat it. Yumm.
